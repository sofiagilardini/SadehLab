Computational Lab of Neural Dynamics @ Imperial College London 

This is part of my code for my undergraduate research internship at the Computational Lab of Neural Dynamics at Imperial College London, where I was using CEBRA (https://cebra.ai/) to produce meaningful embeddings of neural data to decode natural movies seen by mice.

All data has been omitted, and as such the code will not be able to train or test models.
